    "According to the structure theorem, any computer program can be written using the basic control structures . A control structure (or flow of control) is a block of programming that analyses variables and chooses a direction in which to go based on given parameters. In simple sentence, a control structure is just a decision that the computer makes. So, it is the basic decision-making process in programming and flow of control determines how a computer program will respond when given certain conditions and parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basic aspects of computer programming: data and instructions . To work with data, you need to understand variables and data types; to work with instructions, you need to understand control structures and statements. Flow of control through any given program is implemented with three basic types of control structures: Sequential, Selection and Repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python control structures\n",
    "##Sequential\n",
    "Sequential execution is when statements are executed one after another in order. You don't need to do anything more for this to happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Selection\n",
    "Selection used for decisions, branching - choosing between 2 or more alternative paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "###if\n",
    "###if...else\n",
    "##Repetition\n",
    "Repetition used for looping, i.e. repeating a piece of code multiple times in a row.\n",
    "\n",
    "###while loop\n",
    "###for loop\n",
    "These control structures can be combined in computer programming. A sequence may contain several loops; a loop may contain a loop nested within it, or the two branches of a conditional may each contain sequences with loops and more conditionals. From the following lessons you can understand the control structures and statements in Python language.\n",
